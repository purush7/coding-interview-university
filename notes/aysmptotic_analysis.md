> Informally, the term asymptotic means approaching a value or curve arbitrarily closely (i.e., as some sort of limit is taken). A line or curve A that is asymptotic to given curve C is called the asymptote of C.

Best-case:    Omega(1) or Omega(n)
Worst case:   O(n)

If the best-case and worst case asysmptotic rise is case then we can use
Theta(n) which means best-case is omega(n) and worst-case is O(n).
